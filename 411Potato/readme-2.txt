Project Phase 2 Readme

RTL file format
    This file is a csv file with 3 columns: state, operation, and RTL steps
    the last part of the RTL steps is next = x, with x being the state to go to
      from the current state

Datamap notes
    This datamap was hand written; if it would be easier to have the original 
    copy, please let us know as Tristan is holding onto the original copy for 
    that purpose
