[1] Need register to hold robot unit output between end of stage and
multiplexer for WB stage. You'd need to increase your cycle time
slightly. Alternately, you could have a mux into the existing X stage
register, but that'd increase your cycle time more.

[2] Branches use their own adder in your datapath, not X. X should be used for subtraction to do compare in beq and bne. Address when not branching should be NPC, not PC. In other words:
  31,beq0,X = R1 - R2; next = 32
  32,beq1,PC = (X==0) ? NPC + imm<<2 : NPC; next = 0

[3] Would be RobotIn = X. That it's spd would be a control signal, but
the data input is the same no matter which of the robot instructions
it is. -- Update: I'm willing to accept that as plausible RTL to
indicate what that control signal should be. A little confusing due to
overloading the input and the control selection, but I have restored
the lost point.

[4] Would be R[IR(15-11)] = RobotOut (or the register you assigned RobotOut into the previous cycle). There's only one robot data output. Which operation it does is also a control signal, not separate data paths. -- Update: By the same reason as [3], I have restored the lost point here.
